# Covi-Aid #

## Website Application ##

In the Covid Times, this website helps people all over India have a single pit-stop for gathering all information of the 
crucial requirements of the hour such as vaccines, ICU beds, etc. It is available in English and some Indian languages.

### Why we built the application? ###

An increasing rate of the necessity of the pandemic resources parallel to a lot of help providers are out there,
and an effective link has not been formed between them.
Most of the help that can be provided gets lost in between. 
To combat this problem and revolutionalize internet platforms for accessibility of healthcare with added feature of localisation motivated our team to build this stage.

### How it works ###

When we select the language we prefer the interface to be displayed in, the resource required and the epicentre of need district,
clicking the search button leads to a page which displays all the verified twitter tweets related to the respective entries filled in.
